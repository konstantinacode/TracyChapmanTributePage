                    American singer-songwriter Tracy Chapman received wide fame in the late 1980s and '90s with
                    songs like "Give Me One Reason" and "Fast Car."

                <h3>Synopsis</h3>
                <p>Born in Cleveland, Ohio, on March 30, 1964, Tracy Chapman began writing music and performing in
                    Boston, where she recorded songs at the WMFO radio station. She caught her big break in 1986,
                    when a friend's father introduced her to a manager at Elektra Records, and soon recorded Tracy
                    Chapman (1988). The album's most popular single, "Fast Car," landed at No. 5 on the U.K. charts
                    and No. 6 on the U.S. charts. Several years later, Chapman released New Beginning (1995), another
                    widely acclaimed album, which was carried by the hit song "Give Me One Reason." Though her 1995
                    success has yet to be matched, Chapman stays busy as an activist, speaking and performing on behalf
                    of various organizations.

                <h3>Early Life</h3>
                <p>Tracy Chapman was born in Cleveland, Ohio, on March 30, 1964, and at a young age, she moved with her
                    family to Connecticut. While attending Tufts University in Massachusetts, studying anthropology and
                    African studies, Chapman began writing music and performing in Boston, and recorded songs at the
                    local
                    WMFO radio station.

                <h3>Musical Career</h3>
                <p>Chapman caught her big break in 1986, when a friend's father introduced her to a manager at Elektra
                    Records—with whom she recorded her first, self-titled album, which was released in 1988. Tracy
                    Chapman
                    rose to No. 1 in both the United States and the United Kingdom, and its popular single, "Fast Car,"
                    landed at No. 5 on the U.K. charts and No. 6 on the U.S. charts. That same year, Chapman performed
                    at
                    Nelson Mandela's 70th Birthday Tribute Concert, which was held in Great Britain. The album's second
                    single, "Talkin' 'Bout a Revolution," also met with wide acclaim, and ranked competitively on
                    Billboard's
                    music charts.
                </p>
                <p>Chapman received several honors following the release of Tracy Chapman, including three Grammy Awards
                    in
                    1989—for best new artist, best female pop vocal performer and best contemporary folk album.
                </p>
                <p>Though becoming a three-time Grammy winner is quite an accomplishment for any musician's first
                    project,
                    Chapman didn't waste any time before working on her next one. Between performing songs from her
                    Grammy
                    Award–winning album, she continued to write and make rounds back to the studio to record Crossroads
                    (1989),
                    which she also co-produced. Chapman dedicated one song on the album, "Freedom Now," to former South
                    African
                    President Nelson Mandela. Though the album didn't receive the same acclaim as her first, it did find
                    a place
                    on Billboard's 200, as well as other industry charts.

                    The singer-songwriter's musical success again sloped slightly downward in 1992, with the release of
                    Matters of the Heart, an album that peaked at No. 53 on the Billboard 200 and failed to receive any
                    real international fame. Matters of the Heart included less memorable songs than Chapman's previous
                    projects,
                    and fans were put off by her straying from folk and blues to a more upbeat, alternative-rock sound.
                    It was
                    likely difficult for Chapman to predict, at that time, what was to come three years later, upon the
                    release of
                    her fourth studio album.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As the album's title suggests, Chapman's New Beginning (1995) proved to be a step back into the
                    limelight for
                    the musician, selling nearly 5 million copies in the United States alone. The album far exceeded the
                    appeal of
                    Chapman's previous projects, thanks to the widely popular single "Give Me One Reason," as well as
                    such catchy,
                    soulful tunes as "Smoke and Ashes" and the album's title track, "New Beginning." Chapman received
                    her fourth
                    Grammy Award in 1997, for best rock song ("Give Me One Reason"), as well as several Grammy
                    nominations and other
                    music awards.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Chapman's 1995 success has yet to be matched. Since New Beginning's release, the musician has
                    released a handful
                    of albums, including Telling Stories (2000) and Our Bright Future (2008), and toured through 2009.
                    In recent years,
                    however, Chapman has largely stayed out of the spotlight.

                <h3>Social Activist</h3>
                <p>
                    Outside of her musical career, Chapman has long worked as an activist, speaking and performing on
                    behalf of several
                    nonprofit organizations, including the San Francisco AIDS Foundation and Circle of Life (no longer
                    active). During a
                    2003 event to benefit Circle of Life, Chapman performed a memorable duet with Bonnie Raitt, of the
                    John Prine song
                    "Angel From Montgomery."
